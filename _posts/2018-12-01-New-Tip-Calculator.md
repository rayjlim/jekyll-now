## New Tip Calculator

Out to dinner with folks and splitting the bill is difficult. Especially when it's not an even split.
Came up with the idea to create a web app that does the formula I use.

Which allows for each party to enter their subtotals.
*  then gives then tax and tipped final amout for each
*  sums the total

also enter the net total, to figure out the tipped amount
for comparison with summed total of each
